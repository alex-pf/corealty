Many people like to travel. Someone likes to live in different countries. And all time you must make your choice between rent and your own homes. If you live in a rented home you pay more than if you have your own. But if you have your own home and would like to go to the other place you should buy or rent out it. The sale and rent out mays increase risk and complexity. Another point is that you should invest a lot of money to buy your first real estate. Or you can go to the bank for hypothec, and then pay percent.
I see another way. It's the cooperative way.
0. co-fouders make cooperative organization;
1. the cooperative organization gets money from the co-founders;
2. the cooperative organization buys buildings for rent out;
3. co-foudes get dividends;
4. co-foudes rent this buildings pays from dividends  
5. proffit
It's looks simple, but it needs to perfect management system. I think it should be collaboration of Agile practics and Salf management organization.
